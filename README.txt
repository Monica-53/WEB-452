WEB-452 Assignment-1
Project Name: Pillows
Before starting the assignment, I tried many projects with different names.
I failed on different steps several times.
I gained little confidence after trying out many times
Started with the class project and once again failed at scaffolding.
Restarted again and failed at migration twice
Restarted and followed the steps from part-1
In part-2 Added a controller and selecting Mvc Controller-Empty added a HelloWorldController.cs
Ran program to see that it is working 
Changes are made step by step on HelloworldController.cs and ran program to see the outcome.
Required changes are made on startup.cs
In Part-3 on Views folder a NewFolder is created with a name HelloWorld
View/HelloWorldfolder an Index.cshtml is created
code is written on Index.cshtml and checked on browser
few changes are made Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml
On Index.cshtml which is under Views/HelloWorld few changes are made
Program is run to see the changes on the browser
Welcome.cshtml is created on Views/HelloWorld
Code written on it and output is checked on the browser.
so far so good, Hope I will continue without any errors.
